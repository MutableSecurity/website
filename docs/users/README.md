# Introduction

Hello there ðŸ‘‹!

We're thrilled to have you here, when you're about to learn more about MutableSecurity.

If you haven't read the [basics guide](./users/basics/), please consider doing it. It covers the most consistent part of what you need to know when using MutableSecurity. After that, you can continue with the guides above to finish your accommodation journey!

A small observation here is that the arguments from these guides are specified in the long form (for example, `-key`). We want to show you what's their origin and after, when you became accommodate with them, you can find the short form (for example, `-k`) in the manual, which can be retrieved with `mutablesecurity --help`.
