The last two days, our team was present at [DefCamp](https://def.camp), the largest cybersecurity conference from Central and Eastern Europe.

## Presentation

Beside talking to (and drinking beers with) awesome hackers, we had the opportunity to showcase our open-source project in a presentation called "**_MutableSecurity: Life's too short. Automate everything!_**".

The following subjects we're discussed:

- The economic perspective on the cybersecurity context;
- How MutableSecurity can be of assistance;
- [A demonstration](#demo); and
- The integration of security mechanisms to our codebase.

## Demo

The presentation was accompanied by a **scenario** taking into account a small IT outsourcing company's production infrastructure, which consisted of an **nginx web server** with enabled remote access through **password-based SSH**.

Two separate viewpoints are presented in the video below. The first is designated with a red border, which is the **hacker** one. Its objectives are to scan the server ports, bruteforce the SSH credentials using a known username, and exploit of the local file inclusion vulnerability. A Python 3 script is used to automate the final two steps.

The second viewpoint has purple borders and shows how the company's **IT or security engineer** can use MutableSecurity to protect its server. The following security solutions were configured, installed, and tested:

- **[teler](https://mutablesecurity.io/docs/users/modules/teler)** to detect web attacks;
- **[Fail2ban](https://mutablesecurity.io/docs/users/modules/fail2ban)** to detect SSH bruteforce and block it in addition to the web attacks; and
- **[Vector](https://mutablesecurity.io/docs/users/modules/vector)** to send logs from teler and Fail2ban to a cloud-based **Loki** instance.
